### Hungry Herbivore

Hungry Herbivore is a website designed for individuals who are looking to expand their their vegan cooking knowlage and
in my opinion the best way to do this is to see what other people are doing. Vegan food is really starting to take off
becoming bigger and bigger each year but it can still be hard being a new vegan trying to fidn recipes that are tasty and
provide a variety of ingredients (known from experiance).

This is where Hungry Herbivore comes in and saves the day with its recipes being shared and its easy readability it can
allow you to get that inspiration you need to cook an exciting meal. Including a search feature based on difficulty also 
allows you to pick how adventurous you're feeling that day and get cooking!

## UX

The users were my main focus for this site,I wanted Hungry Herbivore to be very visually apealing  so I picked nice simple
colors that go well together, I decided white and a soft purple and I think they fit perfectly. The homepage has
accordions, though the recipe is viewed on a separate page to reduce the contend being cramped and look cleaner. Another feature
is that it is easy to use, will notice you can get to any desired page within minimal clicks (with the only exception of mobile) 
but still this saves the site user time on navigating and gives them more time to use the website for its purpse.

### user stories

- As someone who does not eat plant based everyday, it would be conviniant to be able to find simpler meals that allow for my skill range.
- As an experianced vegan, I would like to be able to focus on more difficuly and complex recipes to bring the excitment back to cooking!
- As somebody who is less experianced with technology, I would like a site that it not only displayed simply but also easy to use.

I belive that Hungry Herbivore meets all of these users preferances.

### display testing

The /wireframes file will show two templates of how I planned the site, little has changed but I changed what was needed.
For example the key now being at the top of the page takes less space and is easier to see. As with the accordian information
I decided to give each recipe its own page to view. The accordian still displays a comment about the recipe which leaves the homepage
telling you the recipe name, difficulty, cooking time and comment which I belive is plenty of information.
