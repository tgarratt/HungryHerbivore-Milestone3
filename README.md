# Hungry Herbivore

Hungry Herbivore is a website designed for individuals who are looking to expand their their vegan cooking knowlage and in my opinion the best
way to do this is to see what other people are doing. Vegan food is really starting to take off becoming bigger and bigger each year but it can
still be hard being a new vegan trying to fidn recipes that are tasty and provide a variety of ingrediants (known from experiance).

This is where Hungry Herbivore comes in and saves the day with its recipes being shared and its easy readability it can allow you to get 
that inspiration you need to cook an exciting meal. Including a search feature based on difficulty also allows you to pick how adventurous you're
feeling that day and get cooking!
