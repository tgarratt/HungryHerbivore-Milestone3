### Hungry Herbivore

Hungry Herbivore is a website designed for individuals who are looking to expand their their vegan cooking knowlage and
in my opinion the best way to do this is to see what other people are doing. Vegan food is really starting to take off
becoming bigger and bigger each year but it can still be hard being a new vegan trying to fidn recipes that are tasty and
provide a variety of ingredients (known from experiance).

This is where Hungry Herbivore comes in and saves the day with its recipes being shared and its easy readability it can
allow you to get that inspiration you need to cook an exciting meal. Including a search feature based on difficulty also
allows you to pick how adventurous you're feeling that day and get cooking!

## UX

The users were my main focus for this site, as if their needs were not met then they would not want to use the site and it
would have no purpose. I wanted Hungry Herbivore to be very visually apealing because no one wants to use a site thats not
enjoyable to look at so i decided to pick relitivly plain colors that go well together, white and a soft purple were my final
choices and I belive it compliments the background and the forms well. You will notice that although the homepage involves
accordions, the recipe is viewed on a separate page and this is for the reason to reduce clutter and give the content more spac
e to breath and as a result be much more pleasing to look at. Another feature is that it is easy to use, to explain to you
how you will notice you can get to any desired page within minimal clicks,with the only exception being on mobile to prevent
screen clutter but still this saves the site user time on navigating and gives them more time to use the website for its purpse.

### user stories

- As someone who does not eat plant based everyday, it would be conviniant to be able to find simpler meals that allow for my skill range.
- As an experianced vegan, I would like to be able to focus on more difficuly and complex recipes to bring the excitment back to cooking!
- As somebody who is less experianced with technology, I would like a site that it not only displayed simply but also easy to use.

I belive that Hungry Herbivore meets all of these users preferances.

### display testing

If you look into the /wireframes file you will then see two original templates of how I wanted the site to look. Not too much has
changed however I modified only what I felt would improve the site. For example the key is planned to be at the left side of the page.
I decided to change this as I felt it was taking up too much space here and was uneeded and I belive having it at the top of the page
also makes it much easier to view. As with the accordian displaying all of the information I decided this make the site look too cramped 
up so decided to give each recipe its own page to view. The accordian still functions displaying a comment about the recipe which
totals to the homepage telling you the recipe name, difficulty, cooking time and comment which I belive is plenty of information.
