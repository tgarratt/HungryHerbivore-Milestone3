# Hungry Herbivore

Hungry Herbivore is a website designed for individuals who are looking to expand their their vegan cooking knowlage and in my opinion the best
way to do this is to see what other people are doing. Vegan food is really starting to take off becoming bigger and bigger each year but it can
still be hard being a new vegan trying to fidn recipes that are tasty and provide a variety of ingredients (known from experiance).

This is where Hungry Herbivore comes in and saves the day with its recipes being shared and its easy readability it can allow you to get 
that inspiration you need to cook an exciting meal. Including a search feature based on difficulty also allows you to pick how adventurous you're
feeling that day and get cooking!

## UX

The users were my main focus for this site, as if their needs were not met then they would not want to use the site and it would have no purpose.
I wanted Hungry Herbivore to be very visually apealing because no one wants to use a site thats not enjoyable to look at so i decided to pick relitivly
plain colors that go well together, white and a soft purple were my final choices and I belive it compliments the background and the forms well.
You will notice that although the homepage involves accordions, the recipe is viewed on a separate page and this is for the reason to reduce clutter
and give the content more space to breath and as a result be much more pleasing to look at. Another feature is that it is easy to use, to explain
to you how you will notice you can get to any desired page within minimal clicks,with the only exception being on mobile to prevent screen clutter
but still this saves the site user time on navigating and gives them more time to use the website for its purpse.
